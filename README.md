* Project Description
   * This project was created in one day. Usually with web designs, I would plan it, make a prototype, then code a webpage to match it. However, I decided to take a different route for this. Since the timeframe was so short, I simply just started coding and let my imagination mold the website. Here is the result. I learned the benefits of Google Devs' mobile simulation tools, brushed up on throttling, and some JavaScript DOM workarounds. Enjoy. :)

* Technologies Used
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * jQuery
  * lodash
  * Bootstrap (will probably remove from this project)
* Running the Code
  * Clone this GitHub repository into a directory of your choice.
  ```git clone https://github.com/avhaymart/SnapsTemplate.git```
  * Open ```index.html``` and off you go!
